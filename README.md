# Exploring 0G Compute  
AI-Powered On-chain Agent (Rock-Paper-Scissors Game)

Based on [chatgpt-web](https://github.com/Chanzhaoyu/chatgpt-web), integrated with the 0G Compute SDK, it ultimately presents a decentralized, AI-driven on-chain gaming agent.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project consists of three main parts:

1. **Frontend (frontend)**  
   - Chat interface with multi-model support, conversation history, language settings, etc.
  
2. **Backend (service)**  
   - Invoke on-chain models via 0G Compute SDK  
   - Support for Function Calling  
   - Provide REST API for frontend integration  

3. **Smart Contract (hardhat)**  
   - Deploy example smart contracts (Rock-Paper-Scissors) using Hardhat
